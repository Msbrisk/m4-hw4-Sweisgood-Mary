            <h2>Musician, Activist, Philanthropist</h2>
            <p> While Paul Hewson, aka Bono, is most well known for his music career, his work as an activist and philanthropist are legendary. </p>
            <h3> Lead Singer and Founding member of the legendary rock band, U2. </h3>
            <p>Bono answered an ad for musicians to form a band that he saw on a flier at his high school. </p>
            <p>The group has now been together for 48 years and has 15 studio albums. </p>
            <h4> Activism and Philanthropy </h4>
            <p> Bono does not hesitate to use his celebrity for the greater good.</p>
            <p> He is very involved with Amnesty International and his charity We Aree Family Foundation that combats AIDS and hunger in Africa. </p>
